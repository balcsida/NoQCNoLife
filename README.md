# No QC, No Life

This application lets you control the **Bose QuietComfort 35** from macOS.  
It lives in your menu bar and allows you to check the battery level and adjust the noise-cancelling level.

QuietComfort 35 headphones have become indispensable to my daily life.  
While similar functions exist in the smartphone app, I spend most of my time using the headphones while connected to my Mac, so I built this app.

The app has been tested on the QuietComfort 35.  
It will probably work on the QuietComfort 35 Series II, but I can’t guarantee it.  
Other models are not supported.

This is an unofficial project; I have not obtained permission from any of the relevant parties—sorry!

## How to Use

1. Launch the application and use your QuietComfort headphones as usual.  
2. The app automatically detects when a supported device connects or disconnects.  
3. For convenience, add the app to your **Login Items** so it launches at startup:  
   **System Preferences ▸ Users & Groups ▸ Login Items** (on macOS 10.13 High Sierra).

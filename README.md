This application lets you control the **Bose QuietComfort 35** from macOS.  
It lives in your menu bar and allows you to check the battery level and adjust the noise-cancelling level.

QuietComfort 35 headphones have become indispensable to many users' daily lives.  
While similar functions exist in the smartphone app, this Mac app provides convenient access to headphone controls directly from the menu bar.

The app has been tested on both QuietComfort 35 and QuietComfort 35 Series II.  
Other supported models are listed below.
